## BUILDING from the sources

As the project is a Maven project, building is rather simple by running:

	mvn package

This will produce the jsqlparser-VERSION.jar file in the target/ directory.

## Maven Repository

JSQLParser is deployed at sonatypes open source maven repository. 
Starting from now I will deploy there. The first snapshot version there will be 0.8.5-SNAPSHOT.
To use it this is the repository configuration:

```xml
<repositories>
     <repository>
         <id>jsqlparser-snapshots</id>
         <snapshots>
             <enabled>true</enabled>
         </snapshots>
         <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/</url>
     </repository>
</repositories>
```
This repositories releases will be synched to maven central. Snapshots remain at sonatype.

And this is the dependency declaration in your pom:
```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.github.jsqlparser</groupId>
	<artifactId>jsqlparser</artifactId>
	<version>0.9.6</version>
</dependency>
```
