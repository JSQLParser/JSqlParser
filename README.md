## Alternatives to JSqlParser?
[**General SQL Parser**](http://www.sqlparser.com/features/introduce.php?utm_source=github-jsqlparser&utm_medium=text-general) looks pretty good, with extended SQL syntax (like PL/SQL and T-SQL) and java + .NET APIs. The tool is commercial (license available online), with a free download option.

## JSqlParser

JSqlParser is a SQL statement parser. It translates SQLs in a traversable hierarchy of Java classes. JSqlParser is not limited to one database but provides support for a lot of specials of Oracle, SqlServer, MySQL, PostgreSQL ... To name some, it has support for Oracles join syntax using (+), PostgreSQLs cast syntax using ::, relational operators like != and so on.

## Support
If you need help using JSqlParser feel free to file an issue or contact me.

## Contributions

* feedback
* bugreports
* pull requests for new features
* improvement requests
* fund new features or sponsor JSqlParser ([**Sponsor**](https://www.paypal.me/wumpz))

**Please write in English, since it's the language most of the dev team knows.**

Also I would like to know about needed examples or documentation stuff.

## Extensions in the latest SNAPSHOT version 4.1

* support for parser modification within **parseExpression** and **parseCondExpression**
' support for table schema for foreign keys
* support for Oracle hints on **insert, update and merge**
* support for **merge insert where** clause

* support for functions in an interval expression
* subArray support arr\[1:3\]
* first support for tuples as simple expression **SELECT myfunc((f1, f2))**
* support for array constructors **array[[1, 2], [id1, id2]]**
* added support for **NOT** in MySqls **REGEXP** clause

## Extensions of JSqlParser releases

## Building from the sources

As the project is a Maven project, building is rather simple by running:

	mvn package
    
The project requires the following to build:
- Maven 
- JDK 8 or later. The jar will target JDK 8, but the version of the maven-compiler-plugin that JsqlParser uses requires JDK 8+

This will produce the jsqlparser-VERSION.jar file in the target/ directory.

**To build this project without using Maven, one has to build the parser by JavaCC using the CLI options it provides.**

## Debugging through problems

Refer to the [Visualize Parsing](https://github.com/JSQLParser/JSqlParser/wiki/Examples-of-SQL-parsing#visualize-parsing) section to learn how to run the parser in debug mode.

## Source Code conventions

Recently a checkstyle process was integrated into the build process. JSqlParser follows the sun java format convention. There are no TABs allowed. Use spaces.

```java
public void setUsingSelect(SubSelect usingSelect) {
    this.usingSelect = usingSelect;
    if (this.usingSelect != null) {
        this.usingSelect.setUseBrackets(false);
    }
}
```

This is a valid piece of source code:
* blocks without braces are not allowed
* after control statements (if, while, for) a whitespace is expected
* the opening brace should be in the same line as the control statement

## Maven Repository

JSQLParser is deployed at sonatypes open source maven repository. 
Starting from now I will deploy there. The first snapshot version there will be 0.8.5-SNAPSHOT.
To use it this is the repository configuration:

```xml
<repositories>
     <repository>
         <id>jsqlparser-snapshots</id>
         <snapshots>
             <enabled>true</enabled>
         </snapshots>
         <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/</url>
     </repository>
</repositories>
```
This repositories releases will be synched to maven central. Snapshots remain at sonatype.

And this is the dependency declaration in your pom:
```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.github.jsqlparser</groupId>
	<artifactId>jsqlparser</artifactId>
	<version>4.0</version>
</dependency>
```
