Error Reports
==============================

Please report any issue to the `GitHub Issue Tracker <https://github.com/JSQLParser/JSqlParser/issues>`_:

   1) Provide the **Sample SQL** (shortened and simplified, properly formatted)
   2) State the exact **Version of JSQLParser**
   3) State the **RDBMS** in use and point on the applicable Grammar specification
   4) Please write in English and post Plain Text only (avoiding bitmap pictures).

Before reporting any issues, please verify your statement using `JSQLFormatter Online <http://jsqlformatter.manticore-projects.com>`_.

Feature Requests
==============================

JSQLParser is a demand-driven software library, where many contributors have shared solutions for their own needs. Requests for new features have a good chance to get implemented when

   1) the request is about a commonly used feature for one of the major RDBMS
   2) or the request is backed by a sponsor or a bounty, which may attract developers to spend their time on it.

Implementing new Features
==============================

The team around JSQLParser warmly welcomes Code Contributions and Pull Requests. Please follow the guidance below and do not hesitate to ask us for assistance.

Create a new Git Branch
------------------------------

When starting afresh, clone `JSQLParser` from the `GitHub` repository:

.. code:: Bash

   git clone https://github.com/JSQLParser/JSqlParser.git
   cd JSqlParser
   git branch <new-branch>

When having a local repository already, then pull/merge from the `GitHub` repository:

.. code:: Bash

   cd JSqlParser
   git pull origin master
   git branch <new-branch>

Amend the Code
------------------------------

The JSQLParser is generated by ``JavaCC`` based on the provided Grammar. The Grammar defines how a SQL Text is read and translated into Java Objects. Thus any contribution will depend on the following steps:

   1) Edit the ``JavaCC`` Grammar at ``src/main/jjtree/net/sf/jsqlparser/parser/JSqlParserCC.jjt``
   2) Add or edit the Java Classes at ``src/main/java/net/sf/jsqlparser`` to facilitate this Grammar.
   3) When have added new Java Classes, amend the Visitors, the Visitor Adaptors, the Deparsers and the Validators.
   4) Provide Java Unit Tests at ``src/test/java/net/sf/jsqlparser`` to test the new feature

      * The test should call at least one time the method ``assertSqlCanBeParsedAndDeparsed()``
      * The test should ensure complete coverage of the new Java Classes.
      * The complete test suite must succeed.

   5) Add the description of the new feature to the ``README.md`` file, section `Extensions`.
   6) Build the package with ``Maven`` and ensure, all checks do pass (PMD and CheckStyle and Code Formatting).

Commit a Pull Request
---------------------------------

.. code:: Bash

   cd JSqlParser
   git add -A
   git commit -m <title> -m <description>
   git push –set-upstream origin <new-branch>
