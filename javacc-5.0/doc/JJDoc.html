<h1>JavaCC [tm]: JJDoc Documentation</h1>
<p>
JJDoc takes a JavaCC [tm] parser specification and produces documentation
for the BNF grammar.  It can operate in several modes, determined by
command line options.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code>TEXT</code></dt>

  <dd>(default false)

	<p>
	Setting <code>TEXT</code> to true causes JJDoc to generate
	a plain text format description of the BNF.  Some formatting
	is done via tab characters, but the intention is to leave it
	as plain as possible.
	</p>

	<p>
	The default value of <code>TEXT</code> causes JJDoc to
	generate a hyperlinked HTML document.
	</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><code>BNF</code></dt>

  <dd>(default false)
	<p>
	Setting <code>BNF</code> to true causes JJDoc to generate
	a pure BNF document.
	</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><code>ONE_TABLE</code></dt>

  <dd>(default true)

	<p>
	The default value of <code>ONE_TABLE</code> is used to
	generate a single HTML table for the BNF.  Setting it to
	false will produce one table for every production in the
	grammar.
	</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><code>OUTPUT_FILE</code></dt>

  <dd>
	<p>
    The default behavior is to put the JJDoc output into a file
	with either .html or .txt added as a suffix to the input
	file's base name.  You can supply a different file name with
	this option.
	</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><code>CSS</code></dt>

  <dd>
	<p>
      This option allows you to specify a CSS file name.  If you supply
      a file name in this option it will appear in a <code>LINK</code> element
      in the <code>HEAD</code> section of the file.  This option only applies
      to HTML output.
	</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
Comments in the JavaCC source that immediately precede a
production are passed through to the generated documentation.
</p>

<p>
The results for JavaCC are given as <a href="JavaCC.txt">text</a> or <a href="JavaCC.html">HTML</a>.
